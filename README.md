Route-calculator-with-html5-Geolocation
=======================================

Get the route from your location to a specific destination with HTML5 Geolocation

This project consist in 2 html files:

-geoloc_from_to.html
-show_route.html

Inside "show_route.html" you'll find a button with which you can open a modal window in which there'll be 
on the left the google maps and on the right the route indications.

This script will run only if you replace "coord,coord" with your destination coordinates in the "geolocal_from_to.html" 
file but it's also important that your browser support html5, because i use the html5 geolocation with google API for 
implementing this system.

If you need further information contatct me by email.
